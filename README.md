# Linguist & Developer

Hello! I'm **Maarten Ymaenik**, a passionate linguist and developer with expertise in a variety of programming languages. While I **main** **Rust**, **C++**, and **Java**, I am proficient in many other languages and enjoy using the right tool for the job. I build efficient, high-performance libraries, tools, and applications with a focus on clean, reliable code.

## My Works

### VXDE - A Rust Library to Parse `.vxd` Files

[**VXDE**](https://github.com/Reanore/vxde) is my most recent open-source project. It’s a **Rust** library designed to parse `.vxd` files, which are commonly used in games and configurations to store key-value pairs. The library can read and handle `.vxd` files written in plaintext format, offering flexibility for parsing configuration data.

#### Features
- **Plaintext parsing**: VXDE handles `.vxd` files formatted as plain text, ignoring spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
- **Delimiter support**: It supports semicolon (`;`) as the delimiter between key-value pairs.
- **No dependencies**: VXDE has no external dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into your projects.

You can find the project on [GitHub here](https://github.com/Reanore/vxde).

## My Research

I am actively engaged in research on **Chavacano Caviteño**, an endangered language spoken in the Philippines. Chavacano is a Spanish-based Creole language with various dialects, and the Caviteño variant is in danger of being lost. As part of my research, I aim to document and preserve the language, as well as revitalize it by promoting its use within communities and supporting local efforts to pass it on to younger generations. 

My work involves:
- **Fieldwork**: Recording and documenting spoken Chavacano Caviteño.
- **Language Preservation**: Collaborating with community members to develop educational resources and increase awareness of the language's significance.
- **Revitalization**: Working on projects to teach the language to new generations and revitalize its usage in daily life.

I am committed to preserving and promoting the cultural heritage embedded in the Chavacano Caviteño language.

## Language Teaching

In addition to my work as a developer and researcher, I am also a **language teacher**. With a **100% success rate** in helping students achieve their language goals, I offer personalized lessons tailored to your needs. Whether you're learning **English**, **Norwegian**, **Japanese**, **Chinese**, or any other language, I provide engaging and effective tutoring.

### My Rates (Per Lesson)
- **One-on-One Lessons**:
  - **$30 USD / lesson** for beginners to intermediate learners
  - **$40 USD / lesson** for advanced learners or specialized lessons
- **Group Lessons** (2-3 students):
  - **$20 USD / student / lesson**
- **Intensive Courses** (5+ lessons per week):
  - **$25 USD / lesson** (discounted rate)

I use a **practical approach** to teaching, immersing students in the language through **interactive exercises**, **real-world applications**, and **cultural insights** to ensure rapid progress.

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in language lessons, and we can set up a personalized learning plan that fits your schedule and goals (Prices are negotiable)!

## My Skillset

- **Rust**: I use Rust for high-performance systems, focusing on memory safety and concurrency.
